Project Statement – Student Performance Factor Analysis

# 1. Problem Statement

Student academic performance is influenced by a wide range of factors including academic behavior, personal motivation, environmental conditions, and socio-economic background. Educational institutions often struggle to identify which factors significantly contribute to low or high performance. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to provide targeted interventions or personalized support.

This project addresses the need for a data-driven system that can analyze and evaluate various performance factors to help understand and improve student outcomes.
